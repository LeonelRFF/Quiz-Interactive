Welcome to **Quiz Interactive**! This project provides a suite of advanced Anki templates built to be accessible for everyone, yet powerful enough for advanced users who want to streamline their card creation process.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Two Template Types:** A comprehensive **Basic** version and a powerful **Cloze** version.
- **Professional Build System:** Modular source code for easy maintenance and contribution.
- **AI-Powered CSV Generation:** Includes specialized prompts to use with AI models (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to automatically generate CSV files for quick and massive card importation.
- **Effortless Import:** Use the provided browser extension to import the generated CSV data into Anki in seconds.
- **Multiple Question Types:** Supports single-choice, multiple-choice, exact answer, matching, ordering, and sentence formation, all controlled by simple tags.
- **Advanced Media Players:** Custom audio and video players with speed control, A-B looping, and volume management.
- **Full Keyboard Navigation:** A game-like experience using W, A, S, D, and Spacebar to navigate and answer.
- **Modern & Responsive Design:** Flawless look and feel on both desktop and mobile, with automatic light and dark modes.

### üñºÔ∏è Easy Media Embedding

Tired of complex HTML? This template introduces a simple, powerful syntax to embed media directly from your Anki collection. Just use the `![[...]]` format in any field.

- **Audio:** `![[your_sound.mp3]]` will be converted into a full-featured audio player.
- **Video:** `![[your_video.mp4]]` becomes an advanced video player.
- **Images:** `![[your_image.png]]` will be displayed as a properly formatted image.

This keeps your fields clean and makes adding rich media incredibly fast.

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Content Generation (The "Magic" Workflow)

A core feature of this project is the ability to generate content rapidly using AI. I have developed specific prompts that you can provide to Large Language Models (LLMs) to get a perfectly formatted CSV file.

### Basic Template Prompt

### **Ultimate Prompt: Anki Mastery Path Generator**

**ROLE**: You are an elite Learning Designer and Cognitive Coach. Your function is to transform raw text into an integral learning path, applying the SQ4R methodology for active reading and generating an impeccable and **technically perfect** CSV file for Anki consolidation.

**CRITICAL MISSION**: Your process is divided into two phases. **Phase 1: SQ4R Study Guide.** **Phase 2: CSV Mastery Path Generation.** Creativity is subordinate to pedagogical effectiveness. Technical conformity is absolute.

**UNBREAKABLE DIRECTIVE**: Your output must first present Phase 1 (plain text) and then Phase 2 (a single CSV code block without headers).

---

### **Phase 1: Active Study Guide (SQ4R Methodology)**

**Instruction:** Generate a study guide based on the SQ4R method.

1.  **S - Survey:** "Before reading, keep in mind that this text focuses on [Key Idea 1], [Key Idea 2], and [Key Idea 3]."
2.  **Q - Question:** "While reading, actively look for answers to these questions: What is [Concept from Title 1]? How is [Concept from Title 2] classified?"
3.  **R1 - Read:** "Now, read the text, looking for answers. Underline or note any data you find fundamental."
4.  **R2 - Recite/Explain:** "After each section, look away and explain the concept in your own words. If you can't do it simply, read again."
5.  **R3 - wRite:** "Take brief notes of your explanations. Do not copy, synthesize."
6.  **R4 - Review:** "Finally, the following series of cards is designed to review and consolidate what you have learned."

### **Phase 2: Mastery Path Generation (CSV for Anki)**

**Instruction:** Generate the CSV file following this hierarchy and technical specification.

## üì¶ How to Install & Use

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Requirement for Keyboard Navigation

For the keyboard navigation features (using W, A, S, D, etc.) to work, you **must install the "Review Hotkeys" add-on** for Anki.

1.  **Install the Add-on:**
    - Go to the add-on page: [Review Hotkeys - Remap Review Buttons](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1762336370)
    - Use the code **1762336370** in Anki's `Tools > Add-ons > Get Add-ons...` dialog.

2.  **Configure the Add-on:**
    - After installing, go to `Tools > Add-ons`, select "Review Hotkeys," and click `Config`.
    - You need to **disable or clear** the default assignments for any keys you want to use within the template (like `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `Spacebar`, `Enter`). This prevents conflicts and allows the template's internal navigation to take control.

### For End-Users (Easy Install)

The easiest way to install is to download the pre-packaged deck file:

1.  Go to the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/LeonelRFF/Quiz-Interactive/releases).
2.  Download the `Quiz_Interactive.apkg` file from the latest release.
3.  Open Anki, go to `File > Import`, and select the downloaded `.apkg` file. This will add the card types and a sample deck to your collection.

### For Power-Users (Manual Copy/Paste)

If you prefer to copy the code manually:

1.  Navigate to the `_build` folder in this repository.
2.  Choose the template (`basic` or `cloze`).
3.  Copy the content of `front.html` into the "Front Template" field in Anki.
4.  Copy the content of `back.html` into the "Back Template" field.
5.  The "Styling" field can be left empty, as styles are included for portability.

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers (Building from Source)

This project uses Node.js and Python for its build process.

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-user/Quiz-Interactive.git`
2.  Navigate into the directory: `cd Quiz-Interactive`
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
4.  Run the build script: `npm run build`

The final compiled files will be generated in the `_build/` directory.


## ‚ù§Ô∏è Support This Project
